# GETTING STARTED
# -----------------
# This documentation is intended to show you how to get started with a
# simple Appium & appium_lib test.  This example is written without a specific
# testing framework in mind;  You can use appium_lib on any framework you like.
#
# INSTALLING RVM
# --------------
# If you don't have rvm installed, run the following terminal command
#
# \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
#
# INSTALLING GEMS
# ---------------
# Then, change to the example directory:
#   cd appium-location/sample-code/examples/ruby
#
# and install the required gems with bundler by doing:
#   bundle install
#
# RUNNING THE TESTS
# -----------------
# To run the tests, make sure appium is running in another terminal
# window, then from the same window you used for the above commands, type
#
# bundle exec ruby simple_test.rb
#
# It will take a while, but once it's done you should get nothing but a line
# telling you "Tests Succeeded";  You'll see the iOS Simulator cranking away
# doing actions while we're running.
